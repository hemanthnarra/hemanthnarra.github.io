*In my very first blog post specifically for this new platform, I describe how I created said platform.*

“Hello, world!” as the title of my first blog post sounds almost clichéd. But I think it’s a good choice, because with this blog, I’m not just starting to write – though that is a big part of it. I’m also taking this opportunity to properly design a piece of web software. Last time I designed a website was long back during my schooling. After school, I have choosen different path that is not anything releted to coding or technology.  

## How I created this website ?

I created this website using HTML, CSS (struggled a bit to style it, tried my best though) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I haven't used any JavaScript and not gonna use it even in future because I don't know the language. 

I'm hosting this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You get one site per GitHub account for free. This is really great by GitHub they made it super easy. You just need to create a repository with **your-github-username.github.io** and add your website files to the repository, that's it. Your website will be up and running at **http://your-github-username.github.io**. You can also add custom domain and enforce https in the GitHub Pages tab in the repository settings.

Finally, **.in** domain, I broght it from [**namecheap**](https://www.namecheap.com/) it costs me $6.75/yr, I have paid this in bitcoin, If you want to buy in INR it is arround Rs.500/yr.  

## How can you create a website same like this ?

If you want a website same like this, You can fork my GitHub repository [**hemanthnarra.github.io**](https://github.com/hemanthnarra/hemanthnarra.github.io). And use it any way you want. 

If you don't know anything about coding, GitHub and still want a website like this, Don't worry I gonna tell you how ? 

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). If you are not planning to have a custom domain then you need to choose an username that is short and memorable because your website address must be **your-github-username.github.io** 

2. Next, You have to go to my repository [**hemanthnarra.github.io**](https://github.com/hemanthnarra/hemanthnarra.github.io) and on right side corner you will see an option **Fork**. click on it.
